HLS Streamer
============

HLS Streamer is a node.js project that enables one to browse their multimedia collection
over their iPhone, iPad, or Mac OS X and stream the contents of their collection to their
device using HTTP Live Streaming capabilities.

Installation
------------

Installation is simple for the node.js part. However, a specially compiled version of
FFMpeg is needed to handle the streaming aspects. Installation of FFMpeg is easily
accomplished using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), for instance.

    # git clone git@github.com:jbenden/hls-streamer.git
    # cd hls-streamer
    # npm install
    # ./bin/devserver

The available directories are configured inside of `apps/sidewalk/routes.coffee` on line
6. Feel free to modify this line to suite your multimedia collection. This should be
abstracted out to a configuration file, it just hasn't happened yet.

FFMpeg Installation
-------------------

Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for installation of FFMpeg is easy. Simply copy
and paste the following line in to *Terminal*.

    # brew install ffmpeg --HEAD --with-x264 --with-faac --with-lame --with-xvid
